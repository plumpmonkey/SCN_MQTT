# SCN Traffic Analysis Lab - MQTT
## Quick Start Guide

Please see the `Week 1-3 Traffic Analysis Lab - MQTT` lab worksheet on Blackboardfor detailed instructions on setting up and using the lab environment.

## Setup

This must be run on the *UWEcyber VM* as the challenge script requires the specific version of Python that is installed on that VM (As of August 2025 - Python 3.8.10)
Before running any scripts, you must run the mqtt_lab_setup.sh scrip once. This only needs to be run _once_

./mqtt_lab_setup.sh
```
